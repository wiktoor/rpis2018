    "In the last problem of the first session we sampled with given probabilities using prefix sums and binary search. The sampling code is the bottleneck of the whole process, its running times is 3 times higher than the code for uniform probabilities, and the difference would only increase for larger number of outcomes. In the next two problems we discuss two simple, but powerful techniques one can use to sample in time $O(1)$."

But even if the functionality you need is not implemented in a lower level language as\n",

In this problem, your task is to rewrite the previous algorithm, so that the amount of *looping* is reduced to a minimum necessary. In particular, you should create a *vectorized* version of random dates generation (in bulk), while the actual search for duplicates remains a loop with a **set**. Here are some useful tips:\n",
